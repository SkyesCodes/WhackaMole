### See planning materials below.  
---
#### This game will be a test of your reactions, how many circles can you click as they become active over one minute? 
---
#### It will be made using html, css, js, dom.

* Main goals (MVP) include:
    - render a game board with 9 circles that can be clicked on
    - The circles will be active at random intervals over 1 minute
    - the circles will render one way when inactive, and show an image when active
    - clicking them within a second of being active will reward points
    - clicking them within a second will render the inactive circle state again
    - a certain number of points will declare you a winner
    - a score counter will display your current score
    - below the counter will display the points needed to win
    - play again button/start button will render under the game board
    - a win/lose screen/message will render after 1 minute has expired
---
* Stretch goals include: 
   - upgrading the visuals
   - sound effects
   - an instance based highscore tracker
   - a harder difficulty (less time to successfully click circles)
---
* Potential roadblocks
    - circles being chosen at random back to back, could be confusing to the players
    - overall responsiveness of circles becoming inactive on click
    - on click functionality 
    - performance on different devices/screens
